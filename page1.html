        <h1>What is Java?</h1>
        <p>Overview of Java, a versatile programming language.</p>

        <div class="java-info-box">
                <br><h2>What Is Java?</h2>
                <p>Java is a high-level programming language that was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Originally called Oak, it was renamed to Java and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. Java is designed to be platform-independent, meaning code written in Java can run on any device that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This capability is often referred to as "write once, run anywhere" (WORA).</p>
                
                <p>Java is object-oriented, focusing on objects and data rather than actions and logic. This makes it modular, scalable, and easy to manage for building large applications. Java supports key concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, which are foundational to object-oriented programming.</p>
            
                <h3>Key Features of Java:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Java code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing it to work across different operating systems like Windows, Mac, and Linux.</li>
                    <br><li><strong>Robust and Secure:</strong> Java has strong memory management features and automatic garbage collection, reducing memory leaks. It also includes security features like bytecode verification and sandboxing.</li>
                    <br><li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> Java supports the simultaneous execution of different parts of a program, making it suitable for high-performance applications like web servers and games.</li>
                    <br><li><strong>Rich API and Libraries:</strong> Java offers a wide range of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and libraries for various tasks, making it flexible for web, desktop, and mobile development.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Since its launch in the early 1990s, Java has evolved from a language for consumer devices to a major platform for web and mobile applications. Its focus on portability, security, and performance has maintained its relevance over the years.</p>
