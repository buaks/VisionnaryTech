            <br><h2>How Did Java Start?</h2>
            <p>Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the tech world today. But how did it all start?</p>
            
            <p>Java was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. It was initially designed for digital cable devices. After Gosling's attempt to expand on C++, he created a project called "Greentalk" in 1991, along with Mike Sheridan, Patrick Naughton, and others known as "The Green Team." Greentalk was later renamed "Oak" for the first version of Java.</p>
        
            <p>In 1995, during the beta phase, they had to change the name from "Oak" to "Java" because "Oak" was already trademarked by Oak Technologies. The first official version, Java 1.0, was released on January 23, 1996.</p>
        
            <h3>Additional Facts About Java's History:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Name "Java":</strong> The name "Java" was inspired by coffee from the Indonesian island of Java, reflecting the team's desire to create a language that was dynamic and powerful.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA):</strong> Java was designed to be platform-independent, meaning code could run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</li>
                <br><li><strong>Java's Popularity:</strong> Since its launch, Java has become a cornerstone of web development, mobile applications, and enterprise software due to its versatility.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Community Support:</strong> The Java community has contributed to its growth, providing extensive libraries and frameworks that enhance its functionality.</li>
